    implements a variety of algorithms for partitioning unstructured graphs,
    meshes, and for computing fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices.
    ParMETIS extends the functionality provided by METIS and includes
    routines that are especially suited for parallel AMR computations and
    large scale numerical simulations.
    The algorithms implemented in ParMETIS are based on the parallel
    multilevel k-way graph-partitioning, adaptive repartitioning, and
    parallel multi-constrained partitioning schemes.";
